# meta-flight-dispersal
No one has attempted to conduct a metanalyses on the flight dispersal of species across orders of insects, including Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Hemiptera. This project asks two questions: 1) how does flight dispersal (speed, distance, duration, etc.) vary across species and order, and 2) how do weight, sex, morphology, and age impact flight dispersal across species and order. Various methods that measure flight dispersal (flight mill, free flight, video recordings, autographs, etc.) will be considered. I hope to see this project and its questions evolve in the next coming months as countless papers will be read and analyzed.
